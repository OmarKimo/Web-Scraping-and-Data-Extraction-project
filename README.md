# Web Scraping and Data Extraction project

## PyQT GUI application that scrapes the search results of a specific website that has different searching filters then exports the scrape results to an excel file

### I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to generate executable files to be run on Windows (.exe) and macOS (.app)
